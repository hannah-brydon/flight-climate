# Shiny App to Explore Uber Data

This is a shiny app I have developed which showcases how to make Shiny apps look nice using `HTMLTemplates`. The app itself explores my uber data.

You can request your data from Uber on the following [link](https://help.uber.com/riders/article/download-your-data?nodeId=2c86900d-8408-4bac-b92a-956d793acd11)

The shinyapp is viewable on [https://vivekkatial.shinyapps.io/uber_shiny/](https://vivekkatial.shinyapps.io/uber_shiny/)

Things to add:

- Ability for users to add their own data
- A more functional dashboard with interesting stats
